# Radial Progress Chart

> Radial Progress Chart started as a weekend project. It’s written on the top of D3.js and was heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/health-and-fitness/">Apple Watch Activity</a> and D3 stub of <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1096355">Polar Clock

## Features

I tried to make it highly customizable for serve multiple purpose. Some of the features are:

- Add many progress rings as you want
- Place static or dynamic text in the center
- Customize diameter, stroke width, gap, colors
- CSS customizable
- Chart data can be update
